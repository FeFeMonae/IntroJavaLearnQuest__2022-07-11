### Instructor Repository for LearnQuest Intro Java

This repo contains:

1. The slides and labs provided by LQ
2. The source code from the LQ VM for the labs
3. The Spring slides and labs I provided
4. Additional Materials

### The Additional Materials
All of the additional materials are either created by Rod Davison under a creative commons license or are published with provisions for sharing. For example, the Thinking in Java Book allows for free distribution of the pdf. Other materials included are also freely available from the original source (Java Language Spec for example) or have been used in accordance to the authors original citation requirements.


### Misc Stuff
I tend to code while I lecture to illustrate the concepts or work through the labs as a demo. I normally make all that available to students. That is the demo folder.

However, these are not planned demos, just spur of the moment jottings often to illustrate a point. It's not properly curated but if you can use any of it, feel free to do so.
